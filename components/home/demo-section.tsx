const DEMO_SUMMARY = `# Quick Overview
ðŸŽ¯ A forward-looking analysis of how AI is transforming diagnostics, patient care, and hospital operations â€” along with the ethical and regulatory challenges healthcare must address.

# Document Details
Title: The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

Author: Dr. Anita Bhatt, Stanford Medical Review

Published: April 2024

Length: 22 pages

Source: stanfordhealthai.org

# Key Highlights
AI models achieve 90%+ accuracy in early cancer detection

$150B projected savings in healthcare costs globally by 2030

Use of NLP in patient records improves diagnostics

Challenges include data privacy, bias, and regulatory gaps

# Why It Matters
Healthcare is under increasing pressure to deliver better outcomes at lower costs. AI can help bridge this gap â€” but only if implemented ethically and responsibly. This document explains both the potential and the pitfalls.

# Main Points
Diagnostics: AI tools like CNNs are enhancing radiology and pathology workflows

Treatment Personalization: Predictive models tailor medication and therapy plans

Operational Benefits: AI is streamlining billing, scheduling, and documentation

Global Trends: National healthcare systems are investing in AI infrastructure

Risks: Without transparency, AI can reinforce health disparities

# Pro Tips
For startups: focus on explainable AI to improve adoption

For clinicians: leverage AI-assisted tools, not AI-replacement tools

For data teams: ensure de-biased training datasets

# Key Terms to Know
Explainable AI (XAI): AI that provides human-understandable justifications

Federated Learning: A method to train models on distributed, private data

Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS): AI systems that assist doctor decisions

#Bottom Line
Artificial Intelligence is no longer a future vision â€” it's already shaping how healthcare is delivered. Success depends not just on tech, but on trust, regulation, and thoughtful implementation.
